Nest
====

Nest provides a high-level, simple [scenegraph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenegraph) for [Processing](http://processing.org), modeled on the API for the scenegraph and display list implemented by [ActionScript 3](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript.html).

Nest is targeted toward developers familiar with AS3, who wish to organize on-screen objects in a display list hierarchy. As with the AS3 display list, Nest establishes parent-child relationships, applies parent transformations to children, and allows easy manipulation of on-screen objects through member variables such as x, y, rotation, and scale.

In addition to the scenegraph, Nest also includes an event-based communication system (built on the [Observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) as implemented by Java's [Observer](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Observer.html) interface), and some minimal UI components.
